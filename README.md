# lenia_jax_numpy
lenia_numpy_fft.py is the implementation suitable for running in the browser
lenia_jax_fft.py is a version suitable for running fast on gpus, used for generating data
lenia_torch_fft.py is an older version that is irrelevant now (since the results are not reproducible due to low level torch fluctuations)

compatibility.py is to test that given the exact same Lenia system and initial configuration, the videos generated are identical
